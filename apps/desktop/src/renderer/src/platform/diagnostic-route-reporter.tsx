/**
 * Publishes which page this window is showing, for freeze diagnostics.
 *
 * Two consumers, because a freeze can be observed from two places:
 *
 *   - The main process, via IPC. It is the only party still alive during a
 *     true hang, and it cannot ask a blocked renderer anything — so the route
 *     has to already be there when the hang starts.
 *   - The in-renderer freeze watchdog, via the shared diagnostic context.
 *     `location.pathname` is the packaged index.html path here (this window
 *     runs a memory router), so without this the watchdog has no route at all.
 *
 * Desktop has one visible route surface: the active local-workbench tab.
 *
 * Paths are bucketed to route templates before publishing, so telemetry
 * carries `/:slug/issues/:id` rather than a workspace slug and issue id.
